Hey!! I am Kavin. I am a newbie to Machine Learning.I haven't done any hyperparameter tuning yet since I'm still in the learning process. Once I acquire more knowledge, I will attempt to increase the model's efficiency.

If you have any suggestions or would like to edit my code to help build a better model by adding new features or making corrections, please feel free to do so.
